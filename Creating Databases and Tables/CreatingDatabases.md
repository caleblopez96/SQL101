# Creating Databases

It's important to remember that although SQL allows you to name databases with a space, it can cause issues while querying it.

Therefore, when creating databases, I'll be using the snake case naming convention.

## To create a database run the following query:

### Query

```sql
CREATE database <name>
```

Replace < name > with the name of your database

#### EXAMPLE:

```sql
CREATE database soap_store;
```

```sql
CREATE database dog_walking_app;
```

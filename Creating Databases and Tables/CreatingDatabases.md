# Creating Databases

It's important to remember that although SQL allows you to name databases with a space, it can cause issues while querying it.

Therefore, when creating databases, use snake case naming convention.

## To create a database run the following query:

### Query:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE <databaseName>
```

Replace < databaseName > with the name of your database

### Example:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE soap_store;
```

```sql
CREATE DATABASE dog_walking_app;
```

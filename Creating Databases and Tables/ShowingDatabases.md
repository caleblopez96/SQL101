# Showing Databases

When you install MySQL, there are some default databases that come with the DB management system. You can prove this by running the following query:

## Query

```sql
SHOW databases;
```

## result

```bash
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
| pizza_ordering     |
| sys                |
+--------------------+
```

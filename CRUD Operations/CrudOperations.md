# Basic CRUD Operations in SQL

CRUD stands for **Create, Read, Update, Delete** — the four essential operations you can perform on data in a database.

These operations allow you to manage the records in your tables.

## Subsections:

### SELECT (Read)

- Retrieves data from a database.
- You can fetch specific columns or all columns.
- Can include filtering, sorting, and grouping.

### INSERT (Create)

- Adds new records (rows) to a table.
- You must specify the values for each column you’re adding.

### UPDATE (Update)

- Modifies existing records in a table.
- You can update one or multiple rows.
- Typically paired with a `WHERE` clause to limit which rows get updated.

### DELETE (Delete)

- Removes records from a table.
- Like UPDATE, it’s wise to use a `WHERE` clause, or you might delete everything.

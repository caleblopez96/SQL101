# Dropping a Database

The term for deleting a database is "DROP".

To drop a database, run the following query by replacing < DATABASE > with the name of your database:

```sql
DROP <databaseName>;
```

Replace < databaseName > with the name of the database that you want to drop (delete)

## EXAMPLE:

```sql
DROP soap_store;
```

```sql

```

# SQL JOINs Overview

In relational databases, **JOIN** operations combine rows from two or more tables based on related columns. They allow you to query related data efficiently.

## Common Types of JOINs

### 1. INNER JOIN

- Returns only the rows where there is a match in **both** tables.
- If no match exists, the row is excluded from the result.
- Use this when you want to retrieve data that exists in both tables.

---

### 2. LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)

- Returns all rows from the **left** table, and the matching rows from the right table.
- If there is no match, the result will contain NULLs for columns from the right table.
- Useful to find all records from the left table regardless of matching entries in the right table.

---

### 3. RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)

- Returns all rows from the **right** table, and the matching rows from the left table.
- If no match exists, NULLs fill in columns from the left table.
- Less commonly used but helpful when the right table is the primary focus.

---

### 4. FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN)

- Returns rows when there is a match in **either** table.
- Rows without matches in one table show NULLs for columns from the other table.
- Combines the effects of both LEFT and RIGHT JOINs.
- Useful to get all records from both tables, matched or unmatched.

---

### 5. CROSS JOIN

- Returns the Cartesian product of both tables (all possible combinations).
- No ON condition is used.
- Use carefully, as it can produce very large result sets.

---

### 6. SELF JOIN

- A table joined with itself.
- Useful for querying hierarchical or recursive relationships within the same table.

## Key Points

- JOINs rely on keys (often primary and foreign keys) to relate tables.
- Choosing the correct JOIN type depends on the data relationship and the desired output.
- JOIN performance can be impacted by indexing and table size.
- Understanding JOINs is fundamental to working with relational databases effectively.
